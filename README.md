# elasticsearch-intro

Examples for an introductory presentation on Elasticsearch I gave at Shopfiy.

To set everything up:

- download the dataset from the link below and save it as `data.json` in the directory of this repository
- make sure you have an Elasticsearch server running at `localhost:9200`
- install the `requests` python package
- run `./build-db.py`

After that, you can execute any of the Python scripts in `queries` to see the examples
